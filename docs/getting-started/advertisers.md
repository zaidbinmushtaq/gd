2. Fill in your company details and contact information
3. Verify your email address to activate your account

## Step 2: Fund Your Campaign

1. Navigate to the **Billing** section in your dashboard
2. Choose your preferred payment method:
   - Credit/Debit Card

:::

:::caution

:::

## Step 3: Create Your First Ad

### Ad Content Requirements

- **Images:** 800×418px (1.91:1 ratio) in PNG or JPG format, max 200KB
- **Headline:** 40 characters maximum
- **Landing Page URL:** Must be a valid, secure (HTTPS) URL

:::danger
Ads that don't meet our content requirements will be automatically rejected. Ensure your images are properly sized and formatted before submission.
:::

### Creating Your Ad

1. From your dashboard, click **Create New Ad**
2. Upload your ad image
3. Enter your headline
4. Add your destination URL with proper UTM parameters for tracking

:::note
Developer-focused ads perform best when they highlight specific technical benefits rather than general marketing messages. Focus on how your product solves real developer problems.
:::

### Targeting Options

Choose your audience based on:

- **Repository Categories:** Target by programming language, framework, or technology
- **Specific Repositories:** Select individual repositories that match your audience
- **Geographic Targeting:** Focus on developers in specific countries or regions

:::tip
Start with broader targeting and then refine based on performance data. Our analytics will show which repositories and categories drive the best results for your specific offering.

## Step 4: Launch and Optimize

1. Set your campaign duration and daily budget
2. Define your bid strategy (CPC or CPM)
3. Submit your ad for review (typically approved within 24 hours)
4. Once approved, your ad will start appearing in relevant repositories

:::caution
All ads undergo a manual review process to ensure they meet our quality standards. Plan for a 24-hour review period when scheduling time-sensitive campaigns.
